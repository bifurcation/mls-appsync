--- abstract

One feature that the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides is that it
allows the members of a group to confirm that they agree on certain data.  In
this document, we define a mechanism for applications using MLS to exploit this
feature of MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement on the state of
the application in addition to MLS-related state.  We define a GroupContext
extension that captures the state of the application and an AppSync proposal
that can be used to update the application state.

# Introduction

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) allows a group of clients to authenticate each
other and establish shared secret state {{!RFC9420}}.  One of the primary
security benefits of MLS is that the MLS key schedule confirms that the group
agrees on certain metadata, such as the membership of the group. Members that
disagree on the relevant metadata will arrive at different keys and be unable to
communicate. Applications based on MLS can integrate their state into this
metadata in order to confirm that the members of an MLS group agree on
application state as well as MLS metadata.

Here, we define two extensions to MLS to facilitate this application design:

1. A GroupContext extension `application_states` that confirms agreement on
   application state from potentially multiple sources.
2. A new proposal type AppSync that allows MLS group members to propose changes
   to the agreed application state.

# Application State Synchronization

The `application_states` extension allows the application to inject state
objects into the MLS key schedule. Changes to this state can be made out of
band, or using the AppSync proposal. Using the AppSync proposal ensures that
members of the MLS group have received the relevant state changes before they
are reflected in the group's `application_states`.

> **NOTE:** This design exposes the high-level structure of the application state
> to MLS.  An alternative design would be to have the application state be opaque
> to MLS.  There is a trade-off between generality and the complexity of the API
> between the MLS implementation and the application.  An opaque design would give
> the application more freedom, but require the MLS stack to call out to the
> application to get the updated state as part of Commit processing.  This design
> allows the updates to happen within the MLS stack, so that no callback is
> needed, at the cost of forcing the application state to fit a certain structure.
> It also potentially can result in smaller state updates in large groups.

The state for Each `applicationId` in the `application_states` needs to conform
to one of four basic types: an ordered array, an unordered array, a map, or an
irreducible blob. This allows the AppSync proposal to efficiently modify a large
application state object.

The content of the `application_states` extension and the `AppSync` proposal are
structured as follows:

~~~ tls
enum {
    irreducible(0),
    map(1),
    unorderedList(2),
    orderedArray(3),
    (255)
} StateType;

struct {
  opaque element<V>;
} OpaqueElement;

struct {
  opaque elementName<V>;
  opaque elementValue<V>;
} OpaqueMapElement;

struct {
  uint32 applicationId;
  StateType stateType;
  select (stateType) {
    case irreducible:
      OpaqueElement state;
    case map:
      OpaqueMapElement mapEntries<V>;
    case unorderedList:
      OpaqueElement unorderedEntries<V>;
    case orderedArray:
      OpaqueElement orderedEntries<V>;
  };
} ApplicationState;

struct {
  ApplicationState applicationStates<V>;
} ApplicationStatesExtension;
~~~
{: #fig-app-state title="The `application_state` extension" }

~~~ tls
struct {
  uint32 index;
  opaque element<V>;
} ElementWithIndex;


struct {
  uint32 applicationId;
  StateType stateType;
  select (stateType) {
    case irreducible:
      OpaqueElement newState;
    case map:
      OpaqueElement removedKeys<V>;
      OpaqueMapElement newOrUpdatedElements<V>;
    case unorderedList:
      uint32 removedIndices<V>;
      OpaqueElement addedEntries<V>;
    case orderedArray:
      ElementWithIndex replacedElements<V>;
      uint32 removedIndices<V>;
      ElementWithIndex insertedElements<V>;
      OpaqueElement appenededEntries<V>;
  };
} AppSync;

The `applicationId` determines the structure and interpretation of the contents.
of an ApplicationState object. AppSync proposals
contain changes to this state, which the client uses to update the
representation of the state in `application_states`.

A client receiving an AppSync proposal applies it in the following way:

* Identify an `application_states` GroupContext extension which contains the
  same `application_id` state as the AppSync proposal
* Apply the relevant operations (replace, remove, update, append, insert)
  according to the `stateType` to the relevant parts of the ApplicationState
  object in `application_states` extension.

An AppSync for an irreducible state replaces its `state` element with a new
(possibly empty) `newState`. An AppSync for a map-based ApplicationState first
removes all the keys in `removedKeys` and than replaces or adds the elements in
`newOrUpdatedElements`. An AppSync for an unorderedList ApplicationState first
removes all the indexes in `removedIndices`, then adds the elements in
`addedEntries`. Finally an AppSync for an orderedArray, replaces all the
elements (index-by-index) in `replacedElements`, the removes the elements in
`removedIndices` according to the then order of the array, then inserts all the
elements in `insertedElements` according to the then order of the array, then
finally appends the `appendedEntries` (in order). All indices are zero-based.

Note that the `application_states` extension is updated directly by AppSync
proposals; a GroupContextExtensions proposal is not necessary. A proposal list
that contains both an AppSync proposal and a GroupContextExtensions proposal
is invalid.

Likewise a proposal list in a Commit MAY contain more than one AppSync proposal,
but no more than one AppSync proposal per `applicationId`. The proposals are
applied in the order that they are sent in the Commit.

AppSync proposals do not need to contain an UpdatePath. An AppSync proposal can
be sent by an authorized external sender.

# Security Considerations

The mechanism defined in this document provides strong authenticity, integrity,
and change control properties to the application state information it manages.
Nobody outside the group can make changes to the application state, and the
identity of the group member making each change is authenticated.

The application data synchronized via this mechanism may or may not be
confidential to the group, depending on whether the AppSync proposal is sent as
an MLS PublicMessage or PrivateMessage.  As with application data, applications
should generally prefer the use of Private Message.  There may be cases,
however, where it is useful for intermediaries to inspect application state
updates, e.g., to enforce policy.

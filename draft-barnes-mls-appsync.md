--- abstract

The Messaging Layer Security protocol enables a group of participants to
negotiate a common cryptographic state.  While the primary function of MLS is to
establish shared secret state for the group, an MLS group also captures
authentication information for group participants and information on which the
group has confirmed agreement.  This document defines an interface interface by
which multiple uncoordinated application functions may safely reuse the
cryptographic state of an MLS group for application purposes.

# Introduction

The Messaging Layer Security protocol (MLS) is designed to be integrated into
applications, in order to provide security services that the application
requires {{!RFC9420}}.  There are two questions to answer when designing such an
integration:

1. How does the application provide the services that MLS requires?
2. How does the application use MLS to get security benefits?

The MLS Architecture describes the requirements for the first of these questions
{{?I-D.mls-architecture}}, namely the structure of the Delivery Service and
Authentication Service that MLS requires.  This document is focused on the
second question.

MLS itself offers some basic functions that applications can use, such as the
secure message encapsulation (PrivateMessage), the MLS exporter, and the epoch
authenticator.  Current MLS applications make use of these mechanisms to acheive
a variety of confidentiality and authentication properties.

As application designers become more familiar with MLS, there is increasing
interest in leveraging otehr cryptographic tools that an MLS group provides:

- HPKE and signature key pairs for each member, where the private key is known
  only to that member, and the public key is authenticated to the other members.

- A pre-shared key mechanism that can allow an application to inject data into
  the MLS key schedule.

- An exporter mechanism that allows applications to derive secrets from the MLS
  key schedule.

There is also interest in exposing an MLS group to multiple loosely-coordinated
components of an application.  To support these use cases, there is a need for a
mechanism that provides application components access to MLS's cryptographic
tools in a way that ensure that different components' usage will not conflict
with each other, or with MLS itself.

This document defines a set of mechanisms that application components can use to
ensure that their use of these facilities is properly domain-separated from MLS
itself, and from other application components that might be using the same MLS
group.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

We make heavy use of the terminology in the MLS specification {{!RFC9420}}.

Application:
: The system that instantiates, manages, and uses an MLS group.  Each MLS group
is used by exactly one application, but an application may maintain multiple
groups.

Application component:
: A subsystem of an application that has access to an MLS group.

Component ID:
: An identifier for an application component.  These identifiers are assigned by
the application.


# Protocol Overview

> TODO: Examples of how an application would use these things

# Application Component Interface

The mechansms in this document take MLS mechanisms that are either not
inherently designed to be used by applications, or not inherently designed to be
used by multiple application components, and adds a domain separator that
separates application usage from MLS usage, and application components' usage
from each other:

- Signing operations are tagged so that signatures will only verify in the
  context of a given component.

- Public-key encryption operations are similarly tagged so that encrypted data
  will only decrypt in the context of a given component.

- Pre-shared keys are identified as originating from a specific component, so
  that differnet components' contributions to the MLS key schedule will not
  collide.

- Exported values include an identifier for the component to which they are
  being exported, so that different components will get different exported
  values.

We also define two new general mechanisms that allow applications to take
advantage of the extensibility mechanisms of MLS:

- An `application_data` extension type that associates application data with MLS
  messages, or with the state of the group.

- An ApplicationData proposal type that enables arbitrary application data to
  be associated to a Commit.

- An ApplicationDataUpdate proposal type that enables efficient updates to
  an `application_data` GroupContext extension.

As with the above, information carried in these proposals and extension marked
as belonging to a specific application component, so that components can manage
their information independently.

The separation between components is acheived by the application assigning each
component a unique component ID number.  These numbers are then incorporated
into the appopriate calculations in the protocol to achieve the required
separation.

## Component IDs

A component ID is a four-byte value that uniquely identifies a component within
the scope of an application.

```
uint32 ComponentID;
```

When a label is required for an operation, the following data structure is used.
The `label` field identifies the operation being performed.  The `component_id`
field identifies the component performing the operation.  The `context` field is
specified by the operation in question.

~~~ tls
struct {
  opaque label<V>;
  ComponentID component_id;
  opaque context<V>;
} ComponentOperationLabel;
~~~

## Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) Keys

This component of the API allows components to make use of the HPKE key pairs
generated by MLS. An component identified by an CompnentID can use any HPKE
key pair for any operation defined in {{!RFC9180}}, such as encryption,
exporting keys and the PSK mode, as long as the `info` input to `Setup<MODE>S`
and `Setup<MODE>R` is set to ComponentOperationLabel with `component_id` set
to the appopriate ComponentID. The `context` can be set to an arbitrary Context
specified by the application designer and can be empty if not needed. For
example, a component can use a key pair PublicKey, PrivateKey to encrypt data
as follows:

~~~ tls
SafeEncryptWithContext(ComponentID, PublicKey, Context, Plaintext) =
    SealBase(PublicKey, ComponentOperationLabel, "", Plaintext)

SafeDecryptWithContext(ComponentID, PrivateKey, Context, KEMOutput, Ciphertext) =
    OpenBase(KEMOutput, PrivateKey, ComponentOperationLabel, "", Ciphertext)
~~~

Where the fields of ComponentOperationLabel are set to

~~~ tls
label = "MLS 1.0 Application"
component_id = ComponentID
context = Context
~~~

> TODO: Should this use EncryptWithLabel / DecryptWithLabel?  That wouldn't
> cover other modes / exports, but you could say "mutatis mutandis".

For operations involving the secret key, ComponentID MUST be set to the
ComponentID of the component performing the operation, and not to the ID of
any other component. In particular, this means that a component cannot decrypt
data meant for another component, while components can encrypt data that other
components can decrypt.

In general, a ciphertext encrypted with a PublicKey can be decrypted by any
entity who has the corresponding PrivateKey at a given point in time according
to the MLS protocol (or application component). For convenience, the following
list summarizes lifetimes of MLS key pairs.

- The key pair of a non-blank ratchet tree node. The PrivateKey of such a key pair
  is known to all members in the nodeâ€™s subtree. In particular, a PrivateKey of a
  leaf node is known only to the member in that leaf. A member in the subtree
  stores the PrivateKey for a number of epochs, as long as the PublicKey does not
  change. The key pair of the root node SHOULD NOT be used, since the external key
  pair recalled below gives better security.
- The external_priv, external_pub key pair used for external initialization. The
  external_priv key is known to all group members in the current epoch. A member
  stores external_priv only for the current epoch. Using this key pair gives
  better security guarantees than using the key pair of the root of the ratchet
  tree and should always be preferred.
- The init_key in a KeyPackage and the corresponding secret key. The secret key
  is known only to the owner of the KeyPackage and is deleted immediately after it
  is used to join a group.

## Signature Keys

MLS session states contain a number of signature keys including the ones in the
LeafNode structs. Application components can safely sign content and verify
signatures using these keys via the SafeSignWithLabel and SafeVerifyWithLabel
functions, respectively, much like how the basic MLS protocol uses SignWithLabel
and VerifyWithLabel.

In more detail, a component identified by ComponentID should sign and verify
using:

~~~ tls
SafeSignWithLabel(ComponentID, SignatureKey, Label, Content) =
    SignWithLabel(SignatureKey, "ComponentOperationLabel", ComponentOperationLabel)

SafeVerifyWithLabel(ComponentID, VerificationKey, Label, Content, SignatureValue) =
    VerifyWithLabel(VerificationKey, "ComponentOperationLabel", ComponentOperationLabel, SignatureValue)
~~~

Where the fields of ComponentOperationLabel are set to

~~~ tls
label = Label
component_id = ComponentID
context = Content
~~~

For signing operations, the ComponentID MUST be set to the ComponentID of the
component performing the signature, and not to the ID of any other component.
This means that a component cannot produce signatures in place of other
component. However, components can verify signatures computed by other
components. Domain separation is ensured by explicitly including the ComponentID
with every operation.

## Pre-Shared Keys

PSKs represent key material that is injected into the MLS key schedule when
creating or processing a commit as defined in {{Section 8.4 of RFC9420}}. Its
injection into the key schedule means that all group members have to agree on
the value of the PSK.

While PSKs are typically cryptographic keys which due to their properties add to
the overall security of the group, the PSK mechanism can also be used to ensure
that all members of a group agree on arbitrary pieces of data represented as
octet strings (without the necessity of sending the data itself over the wire).
For example, a component can use the PSK mechanism to enforce that all group
members have access to and agree on a password or a shared file.

This is achieved by creating a new epoch via a PSK proposal. Transitioning to
the new epoch requires using the information agreed upon.

To facilitate using PSKs in a safe way, this document defines a new PSKType for
application components. This provides domain separation between pre-shared keys
used by the core MLS protocol and applications, and between those used by
different components.

~~~ tls-presentation
enum {
  // ...
  application(3),
  (255)
} PSKType;

struct {
  PSKType psktype;
  select (PreSharedKeyID.psktype) {
    // ...
    case application:
      ComponentID component_id;
      opaque psk_id<V>;
  };
  opaque psk_nonce<V>;
} PreSharedKeyID;
~~~

> TODO: It seems like you could also do this by structuring the `external`
> PSKType as (component_id, psk_id).  I guess this approach separates this API
> from other external PSKs.

## Exported Secrets

An application component can use MLS as a group key agreement protocol by
exporting symmetric keys.  Such keys can be exported (i.e. derived from MLS key
material) in two phases per epoch: Either at the start of the epoch, or during
the epoch. Derivation at the start of the epoch has the added advantage that the
source key material is deleted after use, allowing the derived key material to
be deleted later even during the same MLS epoch to achieve forward secrecy. The
following protocol secrets can be used to derive key from for use by application
components:

- `exporter_secret` at the beginning of an epoch
- `application_export_secret` during an epoch

The `application_export_secret` is an additional secret derived from the
`epoch_secret` at the beginning of the epoch in the same way as the other
secrets listed in Table 4 of {{!RFC9420}} using the label "application_export".

Any derivation performed by an application component either from the
`exporter_secret` or the `application_export_secret` has to use the following
function:

~~~ tls
DeriveApplicationSecret(Secret, Label) =
  ExpandWithLabel(Secret, "ApplicationExport " + ComponentID + " " + Label)
~~~

Where ExpandWithLabel is defined in {{Section 8 of RFC9420}} and where
ComponentID MUST be set to the ComponentID of the component performing the
export.

> TODO: This section seems over-complicated to me.  Why is it not sufficient to
> just use the `exporter_secret`?  Or the `MLS-Exporter` mechanism with a
> label structured to include the ComponentID?

## Carrying Application Data in MLS

MLS provides a few extension points, including `extensions` fields on several
objects and extensible set of proposal types.  This section defines simple,
standard ways for applications to use these extension points.  The intent is to
allow MLS stacks to offer one set of APIs that can serve many application needs,
so that applications don't need to define and negotiate extensions at the MLS
level.

### `application_data` Extension

The MLS GroupContext, LeafNode, KeyPackage, and GroupInfo objects each have an
`extensions` field that can carry additional data not defined by the MLS
specification.  The `application_data` extension provides a generic container
that applications can use to attach application data to these messages.  Each
usage of the extension serves a slightly different purpose:

* GroupContext: Confirms that all members of the group agree on the application
  data, and automatically distributes it to new joiners.

* KeyPackage and LeafNode: Associates the application data to a particular
  client, and advertises it to the other members of the group.

* GroupInfo: Distributes the application data confidentially to the new joiners
  for whom the GroupInfo is encrypted (as a Welcome message).

The content of the `application_data` extension is a serialized
ApplicationDataDictionary object:

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    ComponentID component_id;
    opaque data<V>;
} ComponentData;

struct {
    ComponentData component_data<V>;
} ApplicationDataDictionary;
~~~

The entries in the `component_data` MUST be sorted by `component_id`, and there
MUST be at most one entry for each `component_id`.

An `application_data` extension in a LeafNode, KeyPackage, or GroupInfo can be
set when the object is created.  An `application_data` extension in the
GroupContext needs to be manage using the tools available to update GroupContext
extensions: The creator of the group can set extensions unilaterally, and
thereafter, the GroupContextExtensions proposal can be used to update
extensions.  The ApplicationDataUpdate proposal described in
{{applicationdataupdate}} provides a more efficient way to update the
`application_data` extension.

### ApplicationData

The ApplicationData proposal type allows an application component to associate
application data to a Commit, so that the member processing the Commit knows
that all other group members will be processing the same data.  ApplicationData
proposals are ephemeral in the sense that they do not change any persistent
state related to MLS, aside from their appearance in the transcript hash.

The content of an ApplicationData proposal is the same as an `application_data`
extension.  The proposal type is set in {{iana-considerations}}.

~~~ tls-presentation
struct {
    ComponentID component_id;
    opaque data<V>;
} ApplicationData;
~~~

An ApplicationData proposal is invalid if it contains a `component_id` that is
unknown to the application, or if the `application_data` field contains any
`ComponentData` entry whose `data` field is considered invalid by the
application logic registered to the indicated `component_id`.

ApplicationData proposals MUST be processed after any default proposals (i.e.,
those defined in {{RFC9420}}), but before any ApplicationDataUpdate proposals.

A client applies an ApplicationData proposal by providing the contents of the
`application_data` field to the component identified by the `component_id`.  If
a Commit references more than one ApplicationData proposal for the same
`component_id` value, then they MUST be processed in the order in which they are
specified in the Commit.

### ApplicationDataUpdate

Updating the `application_data` with a GroupContextExtensions proposal is
cumbersome.  The application data needs to be transmitted in its entirety, along
with any other extensions, whether or not they are being changed.  And a
GroupContextExtensions proposal always requires an UpdatePath, which updating
application state never should.

The ApplicationDataUpdate proposal allows the `application_data` extension to
be updated without these costs.  Instead of sending the whole value of the
extension, it sends only an update, which is interpreted by the application to
provide the new content for the `application_data` extension.  No other
extensions are sent or updated, and no UpdatePath is required.

```
enum {
    invalid(0),
    update(1),
    remove(2),
    (255)
} ApplicationDataUpdateOperation;

struct {
    ComponentID component_id;
    ApplicationDataUpdateOperation op;

    select (ApplicationDataUpdate.op) {
        case update: opaque update<V>;
        case remove: struct{}
    }
} ApplicationDataUpdate;
```

An ApplicationDataUpdate proposal is invalid if its `component_id` references a
component that is not known to the application, or if it specifies the removal
of state for a `component_id` that has no state present.  A proposal list is
invalid if it includes multiple ApplicationDataUpdate proposals that `remove`
state for the same `component_id`, or proposals that both `update` and `remove`
state for the same `component_id`.  In other words, for a given `component_id`,
a proposal list is valid only if it contains (a) a single `remove` operation or
(b) one or more `update` operation.

> TODO: Deconflict with GroupContextExtensions.

ApplicationDataUpdate proposals are processed after any default proposals (i.e., those
defined in {{RFC9420}}), and any ApplicationData proposals.

A client applies ApplicationDataUpdate proposals by component ID.  For each
`component_id` field that appears in an ApplicationDataUpdate proposal in the
Commit, the client assembles a list of ApplicationDataUpdate proposals with that
`component_id`, in the order in which they appear in the Commit, and processes
them in the following way:

* If the list comprises a single proposal with the `op` field set to `remove`:

    * If there is an entry in the `component_states` vector in the
      `application_state` extension with the specified `component_id`, remove
      it.

    * Otherwise, the proposal is invalid.

* If the list comprises one or more proposals, all with `op` field set to
  `update`:

    * Provide the application logic registered to the `component_id` value with
      the content of the `update` field from each proposal, in the order
      specified.

    * The application logic returns either an opaque value `new_data` that will be
      stored as the new application data for this component, or else an
      indication that it considers this update invalid.

    * If the application logic considers the update invalid, the MLS client MUST
      consider the proposal list invalid.

    * If no `application_data` extension is present in the GroupContext, add one
      to the end of the `extensions` list in the GroupContext.

    * If there is an entry in the `component_data` vector in the
      `application_data` extension with the specified `component_id`, then set
      its `data` field to the specified `new_data`.

    * Otherwise, insert a new entry in the `component_states` vector with the
      specified `component_id` and the `data` field set to the `new_data`
      value.  The new entry is inserted at the proper point to keep the
      `component_states` vector sorted by `component_id`.

* Otherwise, the proposal list is invalid.

# Security Considerations

The API defined in this document provides the following security guarantee: If
an application uses MLS and all its components use this API, then the security
guarantees of the base MLS protocol and the security guarantees of the
components, each analyzed in isolation, still hold for the composed protocol. In
other words, the API protects applications from careless
component developers. As long as all the components use this API, it is not
possible that some combination of components  (the developers of which did not know
about each other) impedes the security of the base MLS protocol or any used
component. No further analysis of the combination is necessary. This also means
that any security vulnerabilities introduced by one component do not spread to
other component or the base MLS protocol.
